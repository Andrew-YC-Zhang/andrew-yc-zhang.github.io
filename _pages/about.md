Hello, I'm Andrew!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Economics and Business, Goethe University Frankfurt. I'm also affliated with HKU Centre for AI, Management and Organization ([CAMO](https://camo.hku.hk/)).

My research interests lie in organizational economics, contract theory, and personnel economics. My current reseasrch focuses on the AI impacts on organizations.
