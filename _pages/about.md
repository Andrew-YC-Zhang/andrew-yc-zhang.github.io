Hello, I'm Andrew!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Economics and Business, Goethe University Frankfurt. I'm also affliated with HKU Centre for AI, Management and Organization ([CAMO](https://camo.hku.hk)).

My research interests lie in organizational economics, contract theory, and personnel economics. I primarily utilize theoretical models, with a special focus on relational contracts, to study these areas. Currently, I'm investigating the impact of AI on organizations and management.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:Y.Zhang@econ.uni-frankfurt.de).
